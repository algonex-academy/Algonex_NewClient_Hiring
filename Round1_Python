HANDS-ON LOGICAL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS (Python + SQL)
Level: Entry-level/Freshers
Purpose: Tests logical thinking, coding ability, problem-solving, and real hands-on skills

SECTION A — Python
1. Reverse words in a sentence (without using built-in reverse functions)

Example Input: "Hello Algonex Team"
Expected Output: "Team Algonex Hello"

2. Count how many times each word appears in a paragraph

Input: "This is a test. This test is simple."

Expected Output:
this: 2
is: 2
test: 2
simple: 1

Forces: lowercasing + splitting + dictionary usage.

3. Remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving order
Example Input: [4, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [4, 2, 3, 1]

Forces: loops, condition checks, logic — not copy/paste.

4. Given a list of user dictionaries, filter all users with age > 25
users = [
    {"name": "Arun", "age": 22},
    {"name": "Megha", "age": 29},
    {"name": "Rohit", "age": 31}
]

Output:
[{"name": "Megha", "age": 29}, {"name": "Rohit", "age": 31}]

Forces: list comprehension + dict 

5. Read a JSON file and print only the names field
employees.json:
[
  {"name": "Kavya", "salary": 50000},
  {"name": "Ramesh", "salary": 62000}
]

Output:
Kavya
Ramesh

Forces: file handling + JSON parsing.

6. Find the second largest number in a list (without using sort())
Input: [1, 8, 3, 10, 7]
Output: 8

Forces: algorithm, iteration logic

7. Check if two strings are anagrams
Input: "listen" and "silent"
Output: True

Forces: dictionary/hashmap logic

8. Convert a list of names into a CSV string
Input:
["Arun", "Megha", "Rohit"]

Output:
Arun,Megha,Rohit

Forces: join logic

9. Find consecutive number sequences in a list
Input:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 20]

Expected Output:
[[1,2,3], [7,8], [10,11,12], [20]]

Tests: loops, condition checks, grouping logic

10. Clean messy user data
Given:
users = ["  arun ", "Megha", "  ROHIT", "kavya  "]

Transform into:
["Arun", "Megha", "Rohit", "Kavya"]

Tests: strip(), capitalize(), list comprehension, data cleanup logic

11. DICTIONARY LOGIC: Merge two dictionaries with sum of values
Input:
a = {"apple": 3, "banana": 2}
b = {"apple": 5, "orange": 7}

Output:
{"apple": 8, "banana": 2, "orange": 7}

Tests: loops, dict operations, merging

12. ALGORITHM: Find missing numbers in a range
Input:
nums = [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9]

Output:
[3, 5, 8]

Tests: set logic, math logic, iteration

13. Read CSV file and remove rows with empty values
Sample CSV rows:
name,age,city
Arun,23,Bangalore
Megha,,Chennai
,Rohan,Hyderabad

Expected Output (Python list of dicts, valid rows only):

14. API LOGIC: Build a tiny API response formatter
Input:
{
 "name": "Arun",
 "skills": ["Python", "SQL"],
 "experience": 0
}

Output:
{
 "name": "Arun",
 "message": "Entry-level candidate",
 "skills_count": 2
}

Tests: dict manipulation, conditional logic
[
  {"name": "Arun", "age": "23", "city": "Bangalore"}
]

Tests: csv module, file handling, data validation

15. STRING PROCESSING: Extract email IDs from text
Input:
"Contact us at support@algonex.com or hr@algonex.co.in"

Output:
["support@algonex.com", "hr@algonex.co.in"]

Tests: regex, pattern matching

16. SQL-LIKE PYTHON: Group data by key (like GROUP BY)
Input:
users = [
  {"dept": "IT", "name": "Arun"},
  {"dept": "HR", "name": "Megha"},
  {"dept": "IT", "name": "Ramesh"}
]

Output:
{
 "IT": ["Arun", "Ramesh"],
 "HR": ["Megha"]
}

Tests: dict grouping logic

17. Find top 3 most frequent elements
Input:
nums = [4,4,1,2,4,2,3,2,2,1]

Output:
[(2,4), (4,3), (1,2)]   # (value, count)

Tests: Counter, sorting, tuples

18. Handle missing keys gracefully
Input:
data = {"name": "Arun"}

Expected safe output:
age not found

Tests: try/except, get(), error safety

19. Sort list of dictionaries by nested key
Input:
users = [
 {"name": "Arun", "details": {"age": 26}},
 {"name": "Megha", "details": {"age": 21}},
 {"name": "Rohit", "details": {"age": 29}}
]

Sort by age ascending.
Tests: lambda, nested access

20. Write a Python script to log errors into a file
Simulate:
try:
    x = 10/0
except:
    log into "errors.txt"

Tests: file writing + exception handling

21. Convert messy text to clean tokens
Input:
"This!!! is?? Algonex--Tech"

Expected Output:
["this", "is", "algonex", "tech"]

Tests: regex cleanup, lowercasing, splitting
